Lab: Classical Encryption - Substitution and Transposition Ciphers

================================================================================
CIPHERTEXT 1: MONOALPHABETIC/CAESAR CIPHER
================================================================================

ENCRYPTED:
QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

DECRYPTED:
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG

METHOD:
Caesar Cipher Brute Force
Shift: 23 (or equivalently -3)

EXPLANATION:
This ciphertext was encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 3.
Each letter was shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet:
  A→D, B→E, C→F, ... X→A, Y→B, Z→C

To decrypt, we shift 23 positions forward (or 3 positions backward):
  D→A, E→B, F→C, ... A→X, B→Y, C→Z

The decryption was successful because:
1. Only 26 possible keys (trivial to brute force)
2. Contains common English words (THE, QUICK, BROWN, FOX)
3. Instantly recognizable as valid English text

CIPHER DETAILS:
- Type: Caesar Cipher (monoalphabetic substitution)
- Key: Shift by 3
- Keyspace: 26 possible keys
- Attack complexity: O(26) - trivial
- Time to break: Milliseconds


================================================================================
CIPHERTEXT 2: COLUMNAR TRANSPOSITION
================================================================================

ENCRYPTED:
DNETHEEFTLALTAEEWHDLSOCEASTFLLO

DECRYPTED:
[NOT SUCCESSFULLY DECRYPTED]

METHOD ATTEMPTED:
1. Common transposition keys tested:
   - KEY, CODE, CIPHER, SECRET, HELLO, WORLD, FLED, FLEET, MEET, ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA
   - None produced readable English text

2. Pattern analysis:
   - Visible fragments: "THE", "EAST" present in ciphertext
   - This confirms it's a transposition cipher (original letters preserved)
   - Length: 31 characters

OBSERVATIONS:
The ciphertext contains the fragments "THE" and "EAST", which suggests:
- It is indeed a transposition cipher (letters unchanged, only rearranged)
- The key is not among the common keys tested
- The plaintext likely contains words like "THE", "EAST", "FLEET", "DEFEND"

POSSIBLE PLAINTEXTS (EDUCATED GUESSES):
Based on visible fragments and common military/navigation messages:
- "DEFEND THE EAST WALL OF THE CASTLE" (+ padding)
- "THE FLEET HAS LOCATED EAST OF WALL"
- "MEET AT THE USUAL PLACE EAST OF..."

CIPHER DETAILS:
- Type: Columnar Transposition
- Key: Unknown (not in common key list)
- Keyspace: n! for n-letter key
- Attack complexity: Depends on key length
- Status: REQUIRES ACTUAL KEY TO DECRYPT

NOTES:
Without the actual transposition key, complete decryption is not possible.
Would need to either:
  a) Test all permutations for all key lengths (computationally expensive)
  b) Use anagramming techniques with dictionary
  c) Obtain the key from the other group


================================================================================
CIPHERTEXT 3: DOUBLE ENCRYPTION
================================================================================

ENCRYPTED:
HTEI QUNCI KBRWO NFOXU MPSJO VRETH ELAZY DOG

DECRYPTED:
[NOT SUCCESSFULLY DECRYPTED]

METHODS ATTEMPTED:
1. Transposition → Caesar (260 combinations tested)
   - Tried 10 common transposition keys
   - For each, tried all 26 Caesar shifts
   - No match found

2. Caesar → Transposition (260 combinations tested)
   - Tried all 26 Caesar shifts
   - For each, tried 10 common transposition keys
   - No match found

OBSERVATIONS:
Interesting pattern: "ELAZY DOG" is visible in the ciphertext!
This strongly suggests:
- The encryption is NOT truly double encrypted
- OR it uses partial transposition
- OR one cipher has identity mappings
- Appears to be weak/broken encryption

The fact that "LAZY" and "DOG" are clearly visible means:
- These letters were not substituted
- They might have been only transposed
- The plaintext is likely "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG"

CIPHER DETAILS:
- Type: Double Encryption (claimed)
- Likely methods: Transposition + Caesar (or similar)
- Keys: Unknown
- Keyspace: Very large (key1 × key2 combinations)
- Attack complexity: High for true double encryption
- Status: PARTIAL DECRYPTION (can see "LAZY DOG")

THEORY:
Given that we can see plaintext words, this may be:
1. Simple transposition only (not double encrypted)
2. Transposition with very weak Caesar shift
3. Columnar transposition that preserved some word boundaries

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Since "LAZY DOG" is visible, try anagramming the entire ciphertext
with the constraint that it should form the pangram:
"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG"

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. CAESAR CIPHER:
   - Trivially broken by brute force (only 26 keys)
   - No security in modern context
   - Historical significance only

2. COLUMNAR TRANSPOSITION:
   - Much stronger than Caesar when key is unknown
   - Vulnerable to frequency analysis won't work (letters unchanged)
   - Requires anagramming or key recovery techniques
   - Visible fragments can provide clues

3. DOUBLE ENCRYPTION:
   - Significantly stronger than single encryption
   - Keyspace is product of both cipher keyspaces
   - Still vulnerable if patterns are preserved
   - This example appears poorly implemented (visible plaintext!)

4. IMPORTANCE OF KEY SECRECY:
   - Without keys, even simple ciphers can be difficult to break
   - Common key lists help but don't guarantee success
   - Key exchange (Task 2 requirement) is crucial
